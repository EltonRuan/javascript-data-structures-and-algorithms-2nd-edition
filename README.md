# javascript-data-structures-and-algorithms

### Welcome to my JavaScript learning directory!

This repository is the result of my study of the JavaScript book (Javascript Data Structures and Algorithms - 2nd Edition ) that I am currently diving into. I decided to share my progress here to aid not only in my own learning journey but also for those who are interested. Remember that it is still in development, with new updates on the way! ðŸ˜‰

To run the provided code, you have two options:

Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

XAMPP Server on localhost: Alternatively, you can set up a local server using XAMPP and access the HTML and JavaScript files through your browser.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or want to share your learning experiences, feel free to reach out to me. I'm always open to conversations.
